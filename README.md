Original description

Java Financial Asset-Pricing, Risk & Portfolio Management Engine

A free open-source pricing and valuation engine (quant library) for financial products, written entirely in the Java programming language.
The quantitative engine/framework and API provide intuitive, practical, and efficient industrial strength implementations for algorithms and methods widely used in the institutions of Finance and Investment.

A priceless tool for "quants" in the investment sector, Maygard provides a readily accessible catalog of solutions based on sound financial engineering and computational finance techniques for the pricing, risk and portfolio management of

Bonds (or Fixed-Income Securities)

Stocks (or Equities)

Commodities

Futures

Currencies

Options

Exotic Options

and many other financial instruments.

Maygard is a work in progress. The ultimate goal is to create a de-facto standard; a complete and comprehensive layer of abstraction over the complex algorithms that are used frequently for pricing and valuation of financial instruments in application software for the Finance and Investments sector. Maygard aims to free 21st century quantitative analysts and developers from the low-level implementation details of the underlying mathematical and computational complexities, allowing them to build more robust business critical applications with confidence, within budget, on time and on demand.

The solutions in the framework build upon published work carried out by Dr. Philip Barker at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, ideas from Paul Wilmott's publications and other sources. Quantitative analysts should already know the underlying mathematics and models implemented in the framework therefore they simply need to learn the Maygard API and should be ready to use the Java financial asset-pricing engine in their application development projects. Developers without the domain knowledge for finance and investment are advised to pick up Dr. Phil Barker's book 'Java Methods for Financial Engineering' or Paul Wilmott's book 'Paul Wilmott introduces Quantitative Finance' where much of the underlying theory of the methods in the framework are explained.

The Maygard binary is available for download and inclusion in your Java projects as a simple jar file (maygard.jar or a beta variation of this name). Maygard uses data structures available in the standard Java libraries (Java Platform SE 7) and relies heavily on the java.math package. There are no third-party library dependencies. The source code is available for download and online perusal.

Download Maygard beta version 0.1 here: maygard-beta-0.1.jar

There's a bond analytics app Ud™ and an option calculator app Kora™ on the Google Play store that both use and demonstrate some of the capabilities of the Maygard API

A note on the question of Performance
Contrary to popular "propagandized" opinion, Java is not slower than C++. Java is a "higher level" language that intended from its very inception to provide for greater abstractions and versatility while it took some time for innovations in JVM performance to catch up in speed with a lower level and more "bare bones" environment offered by C++. The now available JVMs such as Oracle's JRockIt (JRockIt offers real-time execution, which is especially useful in Algorithmic Trading; if you require hardcore real-time execution, then you must get an RTSJ-compliant JVM) are superior to anything C++ has to offer and the speeds of the numerical operations in Java are only limited by the speed of the executing computer. The point or argument of which language offers faster execution is now mute. Solutions developers in the Finance and Investments industry who want to own the competitive edge should focus on delivering superior software applications offering maximum usability, re-usability, portability and speed, using modern, proven, progressive and highly-integrative technologies such as Java with its vast network of libraries, frameworks and platforms.
